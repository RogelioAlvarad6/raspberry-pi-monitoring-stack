🛠️ Future Upgrades and Roadmap

💡 Monitoring Stack Upgrade

🔄 Migrate from Glances + Uptime Kuma → Prometheus + Grafana

🧠 Reason: Better visualizations, advanced metrics, custom dashboards

🔗 Integration with exporters (Node Exporter, Minecraft Exporter, etc.)

💽 Hardware Upgrade

Purchase a Raspberry Pi 5 case with NVMe support

Add 1TB NVMe SSD for logs, databases, and media storage

🧪 OS Transition

Replace Ubuntu with either:

Fedora Server – better performance with SELinux & DNF

Arch Linux ARM – minimal, rolling release ideal for advanced setups

🕒 Timeline

Later this year (after storage case purchase)
